<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a senior research analyst at the <a href="https://ph.ucla.edu/research/centers/world-policy-analysis-center">WORLD Policy Analysis Center</a> in the Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). My research is in the field of applied microeconomics with special interest in development and public economics. My current work focuses on analyzing the causal impact of national laws and policies on various health and gender outcomes. 
I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the <a href="https://econ.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a> in 2015. I also have Masters and Bachelors degrees in Economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University (Delhi) and Jadavpur University (Kolkata) in India, respectively. I worked as a visiting assistant professor at <a href="https://www.oberlin.edu/arts-and-sciences/departments/economics">Oberlin College</a>a>, Ohio for a year before moving to UCLA.
